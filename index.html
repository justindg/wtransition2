      <p class="ldr-p">
        As part of ES’ strategy to deliver what matters at high velocity, high availability, low risk and the best value, we are making some changes to the structure and composition of some of our teams.
      </p>
      <p class="ldr-p">
        The changes we are making will help us to:
      </p>
      <ul class="main-ul">
        <li>Help us to further embed our operating model and ways of working – moving from project-based delivery  to agile, using squads and scrums</li>
        <li>Reduce focus and resourcing on activities that aren’t a priority for our customers or business</li>
        <li>Increase our pace and agility</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ldr-p">
        As a result of these changes a number of positions will become redundant, and some employees will be impacted. While we will actively look to redeploy as many employees as we can into other roles within CBA, the unfortunate likelihood is that some employees will be leaving us.

    <p class="ldr-p">
      As part of ES’ strategy to deliver what matters at high velocity, high availability, low risk and the best value, we are making some changes to the structure and composition of some of our teams.
    </p>

    <p class="ldr-p">
      The changes we are making will help us to:
    </p>

    <ul class="main-ul">
      <li>Help us to further embed our operating model and ways of working – moving from project-based delivery to agile using squads and scrums</li>
      <li>Reduce focus and resourcing on activities that aren’t a priority for our customers or business</li>
      <li>Increase our pace and agility</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ldr-p">
      As a result of these changes a number of positions will become redundant, and some employees will be impacted. While we will actively look to redeploy as many employees as we can into other roles within CBA, the unfortunate likelihood is that some employees will be leaving us.
    </p>

    <p class="ldr-p">
      We are committed to making the process as easy as it can be, and are providing a new and enhanced career transition program that offers a range of career and personal support services. Leading through such change can be challenging and stressful, and so we are also providing training and support for leaders whose teams are impacted.
    </p>

    <p class="ldr-p">
      On this site you will find a range of information about the changes and support programs.

            <li>ES’s strategy (the atom) remains the guiding light for everything we do. That is, delivering what matters at high velocity, high availability, low risk and the best value.</li>
            <li>To achieve this strategy we have implemented new ways of working. These ways of working can be summarised into the following four categories:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A shared plan – with a partnership you share the same assets and risks. Agree on mutual goals and how to tackle challenges. Together the business and ES will work in partnership. </li>
              <li>One team. One dream – it is about developing the culture for our future to ensure what we do, say and value reinforces our strategy.</li>
              <li>Being Agile – agile is a mindset. At the core are purposeful scrum teams. We adopt agile principles within how we work collaboratively, think and deliver outcomes.</li>
              <li>Moving faster, easier, cheaper and safer – process and automation are being developed at an amazing pace. This gives us levers we can use to save time, maintain safety, reduce steps and costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The key outcomes of this new way of working are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Joint accountability for technology decisions and outcomes</li>
              <li>Everyone having operational awareness </li>

      Leading through change can be challenging. Leading redundancy conversations and then supporting impacted team members as they transition out of the company can be tough and stressful. At the same time leaders need to support the rest of their team, and maintain their motivation and productivity.

      As part of CBA’s career transition program we offer specific support to leaders of impacted employees. A summary of these programs are below. Your HR BP will give you more details.
