      <div class="ldr-content">
        <p class="ldr-p">
          Our industry and customer needs are changing:
        </p>
        <ul class="main-ul">
          <li>Customer needs and expectations are changing at an unprecedented rate</li>
          <li>The competitive environment is intensifying with fintechs, tech companies and traditional competitors targeting our customers, products and markets</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ldr-p">
          With change a constant we must continue to adapt; this includes ensuring we have the skills and capabilities to support our future, both roles we need more of and those we need less of.
        </p>
        <p class="ldr-p">
          The current changes are part of our long term strategy and thinking to ensure our continued future success and to enable us to meet customer needs and expectations.
        </p>
        <p class="ldr-p">
          As a result of these changes a number of positions will become redundant, and some employees will be impacted. While we will actively look to redeploy as many employees as we can into other roles within CBA, the unfortunate likelihood is that some employees will be leaving us.
        </p>
        <p class="ldr-p">
          We are committed to making the process as easy as it can be, and are providing a new and enhanced career transition program that offers a range of career and personal support services. Leading through such change can be challenging and stressful, and so we are also providing training and support for leaders whose teams are impacted.

              <li>During redeployment, the impacted employee is still under your care.</li>
              <li>As such leaders are expected to:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Have weekly check-ins with impacted employees to address any concerns they may have and to ensure that they are connected to the support available to them e.g. EAP, Career Transitions Program and have the opportunity to provide feedback and raise concerns with you regarding the process and their experience.</li>
                <li>Ensure the employee is provided sufficient time for redeployment activities during work hours.</li>
                <li>Make any necessary handover arrangements to allow focus on redeployment.</li>

                <li>The flow on effects of the changes that are being made e.g. if they are a leader who will their team report to?</li>
                <li>Are there key stakeholders that need to be advised?</li>
                <li>What risks and challenges for your team will the change create (e.g. sensitive systems access)?</li>
                <li>The impact on team morale and how you will deal with this.</li>
                <li>Walk the floor. Being visible and available to answer questions, reassure your team during the process of change and to observe and check-in with the team.</li>

        Leading through change can be challenging. Leading redundancy conversations and then supporting impacted team members as they transition out of the company can be tough and stressful. At the same time leaders need to support the rest of their team, and maintain their motivation and productivity.

        As part of CBA’s career transition program we offer specific support to leaders of impacted employees. A summary of these programs are below. Your HR BP will give you more details.
